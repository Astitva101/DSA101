/*Question:
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size 'N'. It only contains 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a solution to sort this array/list.

Note :
Try to solve the problem in 'Single Scan'. ' Single Scan' refers to iterating over the array/list just once or to put it in other words, 
you will be visiting each element in the array/list just once.*/
